# Notes - Node Package Manager

The node package manager is comprised of command line tools that help to intall third-party packages/modules.  
A package is code that someone that someone else has written that can help others to do things. For example the Express package can help with routing and templating.

The node package manager website: npmjs.com  
Packages can be searched for here and each package has its own page where it details how it is used, or installed and provides other information such as the github page and other documentation.

To install express:
1. In the command line run the following command:
    ```
    npm install express
    ```
2. This command should be run in the folder of the application that you will be building.
3. This will add a folder called node_modules to the root folder, which will be filled with the packages that are currently installed and their dependencies.
4. To uninstall the express package: 
    ```
    npm uninstall express
    ```
