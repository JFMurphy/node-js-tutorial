Notes - Creating and removing directories

Deleting a file

> fs.unlink(*name of file*);
This will throw an error if it can't find the specified file so be sure to check that the file exists beforehand.

Creating Directories synchronously
> fs.mkdirSync(*name of directory*);

Deleting directories
> rmdirSync();

Asynchronous operations
Callback functions need to be used in this way to do something when the method has completed.

Reading contents from a file and putting it in a new file in a new directory.
1. Make a new directory (mkdir())
2. In the callback function read a file called readme.txt (readFile(err, data, callback))
3. In the callback function of the read operation write a file to the new directory.
    3.1 When specifying which directory to write to you need to provide the current directory and then the new directory.
    > writeFile('./stuff/newfile.txt);


Delete the new directory
1. Can't delete a directory that has contents.
2. First of all remove all contents of the directory.
    > fs.unlink(*file*, callback)
3. In the callback function perform the operation to delete the directory.
    > fs.rmdir(*directory to delete*)
